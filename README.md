## Installation



### Steps:
- Import CSV into Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com)
- Each file in the repo will contain differant aspects and research that is contained in the presentation, most files have the same dependecies (pandas, matplotlib)
- Install the dependencies for any given file
- Run all cells to see outputs generated

## Features
 > Each feature represents comparsions against various points of data
- Correlations between various rows of data
- Scatter plots
- Box plots
- Bar Graphs
- Linear Regression

## Analysis
1.) Height/Weight

2.) Type

3.) Happiness

4.) Legendary pokemon

5.) Weight/attack

## Assigned Tasks 
1) Aditya - size/power scatter/bar graphs
2) Marshall - Happiness scatter/bar graphs
3) Trey - Types scatter/bar graphs
4)  Matthew - is_legendary scattter/bar graphs
5)  Rajeev - height/weight correlated to base stats
6)  Eric - Narrative of case study


### 5. Height & Weight of Pokemon correlate with its various base stats

**File Name**: Pokemon-hw-corr.ipynb

**Findings**: There is a positive correlation with Height/Weight with Pokemonâ€™s various other base stats like Hit Points/ Attack/ Defense/ Special Attack/ Special Defence/ Speed

- Height Vs Weight is having a strong positive correlation
- Height & Weight is having relatively similar positive correlation with all other base stats

![Alt text](<../images/corr_h_vs_w_1.png>)

**Findings**: 
- Most of the base stats fall under height 5ft
- Most of the base stats fall under weight 200 kg
