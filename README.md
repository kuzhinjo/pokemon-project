- Install the dependencies for any given file
- Run all cells to see outputs generated

## Features
 > Each feature represents comparsions against various points of data
- Correlations between various rows of data
- Scatter plots
- Box plots
- Bar Graphs
- Linear Regression

## Analysis
1.) Height/Weight

2.) Type

3.) Happiness

4.) Legendary pokemon

5.) Weight/attack

## Assigned Tasks 
Aditya - size/power scatter/bar graphs
Marshall - Happiness scatter/bar graphs
Trey - Types scatter/bar graphs
Matthew - is_legendary scattter/bar graphs
Rajeev - height/weight correlated to base stats
Eric - Narrative of case study

## Tech

> Language and packages used for presentation slides:

- Python - Language/Platform
- Matplotlib - Enhanced graphing
- SciPy - Statistics, Regression
- Plotly - Enhanced graphing
